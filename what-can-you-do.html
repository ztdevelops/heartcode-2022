                                    and weaknesses and learn how to handle them better. Knowing who they are may also

                                    Remember, it’s not your job to control that person’s emotions.</p>

                                    reality). If they lash out, think of them as a 3-year-old who feels rejected
                                    because
                                    their parent sets a bedtime.

                                <p class="hidden-text">It's best not to confront a narcissist directly. As
                                    difficult as it may be to constantly tiptoe around them, it can be better to manage
                                    their need to feel in charge.</p>

                                <p class="hidden-text">Don’t try to make them see a long line of behavior dating back
                                    years -- or how they’re just like their father, for example. Instead,
                                    stay in the present when you express requests or hurt feelings.</p>

                                <li>Don’t give them ammunition</li>
                                <p class="hidden-text">Narcissists need to feel superior. Anything you share with
                                    narcissists may eventually be used to humiliate or manipulate you, particularly when
                                    you are most vulnerable or in need. Be mindful about what you reveal.
                                </p>

                                <li> Don’t expect them to own their part</li>
                                <p class="hidden-text">Narcissists take credit and give blame. They do not apologize or
                                    admit responsibility. Seeking to get narcissists to be accountable for unhealthy
                                    behavior can be a waste of time. Narcissists believe they have more rights than
                                    others and have little interest in introspection. They love to look at their
                                    accomplishments, successes, or "special" talents, but fear looking within or owning
                                    their mistakes. If you want to hold them accountable, fine—but do so because you need
                                    to say it, not because you expect they will ever hear or validate your concerns.
